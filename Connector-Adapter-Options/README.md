##### Note: For 24AWG you need to twist the wires and fold them over once to obtain a secure connection or use smaller wire nuts(They make a 24-18AWG which is perfect but color varies).  Gray Wire Nuts are common though and can be found in most hardware stores.  
  
### Screwdown to T-Taps (Wire Splices)

The image pictured below is a custom build with the programming header removed, and the screwdown block replaced by a 4 pin header which was soldered in place and then broken off once the adapter was added on. I easily performed all of these modifications by hand using both a soldering iron and hot air rework station.
